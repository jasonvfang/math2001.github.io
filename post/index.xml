      <description>The find command in bash is quite powerful, and knowing the basics might save you some scripting.
What does it do? It &amp;ldquo;finds&amp;rdquo; files. By default, it outputs their path relative to where you ran find. But, in addition of providing you with advanced &amp;ldquo;filters&amp;rdquo; it actually allows you to run commands on each of those files.

      <description>When you want to deploy a static website built with the fantastic Hugo on GitHub pages, you don&amp;rsquo;t have 100 of possibilities. A clean one, and an easy one ðŸ˜„.
The easy one is to build your website to the docs folder. It&amp;rsquo;s not super clean though since the source code is on the same branch as the built code. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t make diffing super great, gives a long output when you commit, you have to build at every single commit to keep consistent.</description>

      <description>Python is by far my favorite language (I even wish we spoke it ðŸ˜„).
One thing I found funny about it, and in the same time really good, is its zen.
They&amp;rsquo;re basically guidelines.
So, today, dans un Ã©lan d&amp;rsquo;inspiration, I decided to write my own. Here it is:
Keep it simple. Lazyness is a quality. Learn to use your tools efficiently. Get inspired by great things. Do one thing, and do it well.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone!
My name&amp;rsquo;s Mathieu Paturel - @math2001 - and I love coding.
I&amp;rsquo;m French (from Provence, if you know where that is), but my family and I moved 2 years ago to Australia so that we could learn to speak fluently English (without this disgusting accent ðŸ˜„).
How did I discovered coding It all started with the basic &amp;ldquo;programming language&amp;rdquo; (notice the quotes ðŸ˜„). My farther taught me the very basic of programming (and it was pretty much all you could do with this language I&amp;rsquo;d ðŸ˜†).</description>
