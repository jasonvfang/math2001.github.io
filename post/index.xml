      <description>Python is by far my favorite language (I even wish we spoke it ðŸ˜„).
One thing I found funny about it, and in the same time really good, is its zen.
They&amp;rsquo;re basically guidelines.

      <description>Hello everyone!
My name&amp;rsquo;s Mathieu Paturel - @math2001 - and I love coding.
I&amp;rsquo;m French (from Provence, if you know where that is), but my family and I moved 2 years ago to Australia so that we could learn to speak fluently English (without this disgusting accent ðŸ˜„).
How did I discovered coding It all started with the basic &amp;ldquo;programming language&amp;rdquo; (notice the quotes ðŸ˜„). My farther taught me the very basic of programming (and it was pretty much all you could do with this language I&amp;rsquo;d ðŸ˜†).</description>
